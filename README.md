# VeriDraws
VeriDraws is a Web3 platform that enables users to create and join blockchain-verified lucky draws and raffles. Built on the Solana blockchain, it ensures transparency and fairness through verifiable random functions (VRF). Users can connect their crypto wallets, participate in draws, and view results that are provably fair and recorded on-chain.
